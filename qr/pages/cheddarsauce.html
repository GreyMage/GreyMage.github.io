<label id="title">Cheddar Sauce</label>
<ul>
	<li>0.8oz White Roux (50/50 works)</li>
	<li>1 Cup Milk</li>
	<li>1 Cup Cheddar Cheese</li>
</ul>
<p>My book says 40/60 fat/flour is good for roux, but this calls for 50/50, seems to work well.</p>
<p>Be careful combining the roux and the milk, temp shock causes clumps. do not overheat the roux.</p>
<p>Make into bechemel first, then add cheddar.</p>
